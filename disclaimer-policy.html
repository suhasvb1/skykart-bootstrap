            <b>Disclaimer Policy: Our Commitment</b><br><br>

            This Statement sets out the Skykart privacy policy in respect of personal information which you may provide to Skykart. Skykart recognises that your privacy is very important to you and we are committed to promoting confidence in the manner in which your personal information is handled by us. The statement that follows explains how Skykart collects, uses, discloses and protects this information on its website.<br><br>
            
            <b>Supporting Industry Best Practice</b><br><br>
            
            Skykart is bound by, and committed to supporting, the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) set out in the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000. The aim of Skykart is both to support and to ensure that it complies with the NPPs that form the basis of laws introduced to strengthen privacy protection for the general public. We believe that in supporting industry best practice this statement will address any potential concerns you may have about how personal information you provide to us is stored, used and accessed.<br><br>
            
            <b>Collection of Information</b><br><br>
            
            Skykart receives and stores transaction information, information you enter on our website or have provided to us in application, registration or administration processes.<br><br>
            
            Wherever it is lawful and practicable, Skykart will endeavour to provide you with the option of not identifying yourself or not providing personal information when entering transactions with us. However, failure to provide the full and complete information we request may result in a limited ability on our part to offer or deliver complete services to you.<br><br>
            
            No personal information is collected when you browse anonymously. Anonymous browsing is when personally identifiable information is not required by an individual to gain access to our web site. In addition, personally identifiable information such as name, birthdates and contact details (email addresses) are only collected when you make an enquiry, place an order, book on a course or register to use the member only section. All other information will be requested from you directly.<br><br>
            
            Information collected is kept for as long as it is needed to service your account and provide services and products requested by you. When your information is no longer needed for these purposes we will destroy or permanently render anonymous any information held about you.<br><br>
            
             
            <b>Use and Disclosure of Information</b><br><br>
            
            The primary purpose in collecting information from you is to enable us to fulfil our business commitments to you in providing management education and training, consultancy, events, membership and to improve these services to you and other clients of Skykart.<br><br>
            
            We may use the information you provide to help improve the services we deliver to you, measure consumer interest in Skykart services, inform you of other Skykart products and services or to comply with requirements under the law.<br><br>
            
            We will only collect and store information about you that is necessary. The information you provide may be used to offer, provide and improve our services to you and may also be disclosed to other parties such as Skykart, organizations contracted to operate and maintain Skykart databases, provide IT support Services and distribute Skykart information, and other services providers that are affiliated with or support the provision of educational services offered by Skykart.<br><br>
            
            Skykart does not permit these parties to use information about you for any other purpose than to perform the services that Skykart has instructed them to provide. All suppliers, agents and third party companies must sign a confidentiality agreement with Skykart before any personal information is disclosed by Skykart.<br><br>
            
            Skykart will not, without your consent, disclose personal information for any purpose (a Secondary purpose) other than for the main purpose (Primary purpose) of fulfilling our business commitments to you, except where: it is required or authorized by law or for purposes of law enforcement and matters directly related to law enforcement or the prevention of unlawful activity; the Secondary Purpose is related to the primary purpose (or directly related when sensitive information is involved) and there is a reasonable expectation that we would use or disclose the information in the circumstances;<br><br>
            
            Skykart reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent any serious and imminent threat to any person's life, health or safety or the public's health or safety.<br><br>
            
            Skykart will not otherwise disclose your personal information to any other party without your consent.<br><br>
            
            <b>Third Party Relationships</b><br><br>
            
            To provide you with a more informative online experience Skykart does use the online resources, from time to time, of suppliers, agents and business partners. Such services comprise of links to third party sites that promote additional services and products. In any such relationship Skykart takes all reasonable steps to ensure that these parties have and enforce an adequate privacy policy. Understandably, the privacy policy of a third party might be different to that of Skykart and it is advisable that you carefully review any third party's privacy policy before using the site's products and/or services.<br><br>
            
            Skykart uses Web Advantage to provide a secure environment for the authorization of credit card transactions over the Internet. Confidential information including client credit card details are encrypted the moment they are transmitted from the client's browser to the banking network using industry standard SSL 128-bit RC4 encryption technology.<br><br>
            
            A client's credit card details are not stored anywhere on the Internet and the only company who has access to this data is the merchant's bank. The bank also sends confirmation information via the same encryption technology back to the client's browser. These secure processes provide clients with peace of mind when purchasing online.<br><br>
            
            <b>Storage and Security of Personal Information</b><br><br>
            
            Skykart will use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that you only provide personal information in a secure environment and when the information is no, longer needed it will be destroyed or permanently render anonymous.<br><br>
            
            Where indicated by a lock (on the browser window), we protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information, you input. In conjunction with our key suppliers and agents, we operate secure data networks protected by an industry standard firewall and password protection system. We also take care to ensure that we have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, alteration, modification or disclosure of your user data under our control.<br><br>
            
            The security of any information (including personal information) downloaded and stored on your PC/Server etc is the responsibility of the individual. The individual is also responsible for the correct configuration of the hardware and software he/she uses to access an Skykart website, along with the physical security and maintenance of that equipment.<br><br>
            
            Not with standing the fact that we take all reasonable steps to protect your personal data including the use of encryption technology, we cannot guarantee the security of any data you disclose online. You can help us keep your personal information secure by ensuring that any password you use on our web site is kept strictly confidential, and by logging off when you have finished using a shared computer.<br><br>
            
            Skykart imposes strict rules on its employees who have access either to the databases that store your user information or to the servers that host our services and while we cannot guarantee that any unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, misuse or alteration to your data will not occur, we will take all reasonable steps to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.<br><br>
            
            You accept the inherent security implications of dealing online over the Internet and will not hold Young greens or its agents or suppliers responsible for any breach of security.<br><br>

            <b>ccessing and Changing Your Personal Information</b><br><br>
